        <h2> Google Arts & Culture </h2>
        <p>
            <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com target="_blank"> <strong>Google Arts & Culture </strong></a> 
            is a project that was initially launched by 
            Google in 2011 as <em>Google Art Project</em>. It is an online archive that contains 
            high definition images of artworks belonging to museum’s from all over the world. 
            It also provides a virtual tour of the galleries where the works of art are exposed. 
        </p>

        <p>
            You can explore the museums through Google Street View, and artworks are captured in 
            high quality and extreme detail thanks to a new photographic camera invented in 2016 
            called <strong>Art Camera</strong>, which has a resolution of 7 gigapixel. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The online collection is made for everyone: from researches to curios visitors who would 
            like to browse museum’s collections. Visitors do not need to have any previous knowledge 
            on the topic, the website will provide suggestions on elements you might like to view and 
            know more about. I believe visitors are expected to look up a particular artwork or museum, 
            but could also choose to look a particular <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com/project target="_blank" >theme</a> . 
            They are expected to feel inspired and I 
            believe also surprised by the quantity of information provided: the website is extremely 
            interactive and besides artworks and virtual tours, you can also find small videos, podcast 
            suggestions, expositions, blog articles, puzzles.

        </p>

        <p>
            The most interesting features I found while exploring the website are: 
<ul>
<li>the <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com/nearby target="_blank"> <strong>‘near you’</strong></a>section 
    where you can discover museums that are geographically close 
    to your current or desired location.</li>
    <li>the <strong>hyperlinks </strong> used to keep visitors on the platform and intrigue 
        them by taking them to pages of other attractions</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p> You can search the <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com/partner target="_blank"> <strong>collection</strong></a>:
<ul>

    <li>alphabetically</li>
    <li>geographically</li>
    <li>or randomly by looking at the “All” category</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p> The <strong>metadata</strong> varied according to the artwork and museum they belonged to, but the most popular are:
    <ol>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Style</li>
        <li>Provenance</li>
        <li>Original title</li>
        <li>Dimension</li>
        <li>Type</li>
        <li>External link</li>
        <li>Material</li>
    </ol>

</p>

    One of my favorite parts of the website was the 
    <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com/story/mAWxq7mCQ7kNKw target="_blank">Macchu Picchu virtual tour</a>, 
    where you can see learn its history and see <em> 5 Spectacular Views of Machu Picchu </em> . 
    I also enjoyed watching all the details of one of my favorite paintings <em>The Starry Night by Van Gogh</em> 
    of which Google Arts & Culture created a focus titled <a href=https://artsandculture.google.com/story/egVRmbCQ5tyrVA 
    target="_blank">Zoom Van Gogh’s ‘The Starry Night’</a> <br>
