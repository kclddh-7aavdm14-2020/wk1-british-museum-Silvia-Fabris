<h1> Exploring the British Museum's website </h1>

<p> The <strong> British Museum website </strong> is extremely broad and covers a variety of different topics, from providing information about visiting the collection, 
    to blog articles and the museum's podcast. </p>

<p> The museum itself was first founded in <strong> 1753</strong>, when the Act of Parliament purchased a great number of pieces belonging to <strong>Sir Hans Sloane</strong>'s 
    collection. Now it is one of the most important museums of the world, as proven by its extensive <strong>online database</strong> of objects present in the collection. 
    The online collection was created in 2007 to adapt to the growing request of becoming digital and allow visitors and researches to explore and acquire useful information 
    on the Museum.</p>

<p>The objects that now are part of the British Museum's collection were either purchased, excavated, donated, commissioned or were acquired 
    due to a conflict or colonial activity. The pieces come from all over the world. The online collection is divided in <strong> themes </strong> reflecting 
    the <strong>place of origin</strong>: Americas, China, Africa, Egypt, but objects are also categorized according to what they <strong>represent</strong>, such as 
    Animals, Death and Memory, Desire, love and Identity.</p>

<p> The <strong>metadata</strong> shown for most of the artifacts displayed on the online collection are: object type, museum number, description, cultures/periods, findspot, 
    materials, technique, dimensions, location (within the museum), exhibition history, condition, subjects, associated names, acquisition name and date, department, and conservation. </p>

<p> An interesting feature of the museum's website is the possibility to explore the <strong>virtual Galleries</strong> of the Oceania and the Prints and Drawings collections 
    and enjoy a <strong>virtual tour</strong> through Google Street view. You can explore more than 60 galleries, making this the world's largest indoor space on Google Street view. My personal favorite were the <strong>Egyptian Sculpture</strong>'s rooms, where you could admire up close the <em>Rosetta Stone</em>, and the rooms dedicated to the Parthenon's marbles and sculptures, which have a peculiar history of how they were acquired by the museum that is addressed on <em> The Parthenon's Sculpture</em> webpage.</p>
